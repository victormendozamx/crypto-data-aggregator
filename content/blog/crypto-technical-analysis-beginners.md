Technical analysis is a crucial skill for crypto traders. This guide covers essential indicators and chart patterns to help you make better trading decisions.

## What is Technical Analysis?

Technical analysis (TA) studies price movements and trading volume to predict future price action. Key principles:

1. **Price discounts everything** - All known information is reflected in price
2. **Price moves in trends** - Trends tend to persist until they don't
3. **History repeats** - Patterns recur because human psychology is constant

## Essential Chart Types

### Candlestick Charts

The most popular chart type in crypto:

**Anatomy of a candlestick:**
- Body: Open to close price
- Wicks: High and low prices
- Green/white: Price went up
- Red/black: Price went down

**Time frames:**
- 1m, 5m, 15m: Scalping
- 1h, 4h: Day trading
- Daily, weekly: Swing trading
- Monthly: Long-term investing

## Key Indicators

### 1. Moving Averages (MA)

Average price over a period, smoothing out noise.

**Simple Moving Average (SMA):**
```
SMA = Sum of prices / Number of periods
```

**Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**
- Weights recent prices more heavily
- More responsive to new information

**Common periods:**
- 20 EMA: Short-term trend
- 50 SMA: Medium-term trend
- 200 SMA: Long-term trend (key level)

**Trading signals:**
- **Golden Cross**: 50 MA crosses above 200 MA (bullish)
- **Death Cross**: 50 MA crosses below 200 MA (bearish)
- **Price above MA**: Bullish bias
- **Price below MA**: Bearish bias

### 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Momentum oscillator measuring speed and change of price movements.

**Scale:** 0 to 100

**Interpretation:**
- **Above 70**: Overbought (potential reversal down)
- **Below 30**: Oversold (potential reversal up)
- **50 level**: Trend direction indicator

**Divergences:**
- **Bullish divergence**: Price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low
- **Bearish divergence**: Price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high

### 3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

Trend-following momentum indicator.

**Components:**
- **MACD line**: 12 EMA - 26 EMA
- **Signal line**: 9 EMA of MACD line
- **Histogram**: Difference between MACD and signal

**Signals:**
- MACD crosses above signal: Bullish
- MACD crosses below signal: Bearish
- Histogram increasing: Momentum building
- Histogram decreasing: Momentum fading

### 4. Bollinger Bands

Volatility indicator with three lines.

**Components:**
- Middle band: 20-period SMA
- Upper band: SMA + (2 × standard deviation)
- Lower band: SMA - (2 × standard deviation)

**Interpretation:**
- **Price at upper band**: Potentially overbought
- **Price at lower band**: Potentially oversold
- **Bands widening**: Volatility increasing
- **Bands squeezing**: Breakout coming

### 5. Volume

Number of shares/tokens traded in a period.

**Volume analysis:**
- **High volume + price up**: Strong buying
- **High volume + price down**: Strong selling
- **Low volume price moves**: Weak, may reverse
- **Volume precedes price**: Watch for volume spikes

## Support and Resistance

### Support

Price level where buying pressure exceeds selling:

- Previous lows often become support
- More touches = stronger support
- Broken support becomes resistance

### Resistance

Price level where selling pressure exceeds buying:

- Previous highs often become resistance
- More touches = stronger resistance
- Broken resistance becomes support

### Key Levels to Watch

- Round numbers ($50,000, $100,000)
- Previous all-time highs/lows
- Major moving averages
- Fibonacci levels

## Chart Patterns

### Reversal Patterns

**Head and Shoulders (bearish):**
- Left shoulder, head, right shoulder
- Neckline break confirms pattern
- Target: Height of pattern

**Inverse Head and Shoulders (bullish):**
- Opposite of above
- Bullish reversal pattern

**Double Top (bearish):**
- Two peaks at similar level
- Reversal after failed breakout

**Double Bottom (bullish):**
- Two troughs at similar level
- Bullish reversal signal

### Continuation Patterns

**Bull Flag:**
- Strong move up (flagpole)
- Consolidation with slight downward drift (flag)
- Breakout continues uptrend

**Bear Flag:**
- Strong move down (flagpole)
- Consolidation with slight upward drift
- Breakdown continues downtrend

**Ascending Triangle:**
- Flat resistance, rising support
- Bullish breakout typical

**Descending Triangle:**
- Flat support, falling resistance
- Bearish breakdown typical

## Fibonacci Levels

Based on mathematical sequence found in nature.

**Key retracement levels:**
- 23.6%
- 38.2%
- 50%
- 61.8% (golden ratio)
- 78.6%

**Using Fibonacci:**
1. Identify major swing high and low
2. Draw Fibonacci from low to high (uptrend)
3. Watch for bounces at retracement levels
4. 61.8% often provides strong support

## Putting It Together

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis

1. **Higher timeframe**: Identify trend direction
2. **Trading timeframe**: Find entry signals
3. **Lower timeframe**: Fine-tune entries

Example:
- Daily chart: Uptrend
- 4-hour chart: Pullback to support
- 1-hour chart: Entry on bounce

### Confluence Trading

Look for multiple signals aligning:

- Price at support + RSI oversold + 200 MA = Strong buy signal
- Resistance + overbought RSI + bearish divergence = Strong sell signal

More confluence = higher probability trade.

### Risk Management

Technical analysis isn't foolproof:

**Stop-losses:**
- Always use stop-losses
- Place below support (longs) or above resistance (shorts)
- Risk only 1-2% per trade

**Position sizing:**
```
Position Size = (Account × Risk %) / Stop Distance
```

**Risk/Reward:**
- Minimum 1:2 risk/reward ratio
- Win rate × reward must exceed loss rate × risk

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Analysis Paralysis

Too many indicators = confusion

**Solution:** Master 2-3 indicators first

### 2. Ignoring Timeframes

What's bullish on 1h may be bearish on daily

**Solution:** Always check higher timeframes

### 3. Fighting the Trend

Trying to catch tops and bottoms

**Solution:** Trade with the trend

### 4. Ignoring Volume

Price moves without volume are suspect

**Solution:** Always confirm with volume

### 5. Overtrading

Taking every setup you see

**Solution:** Quality over quantity

## Building a Trading Plan

### Entry Criteria

Define exactly what must happen:

1. Trend direction (higher timeframe)
2. Entry signal (indicator or pattern)
3. Confirmation (volume or second indicator)

### Exit Criteria

Know when to exit before entering:

1. Stop-loss level (based on support/resistance)
2. Take-profit target (based on resistance or risk/reward)
3. Time-based exit (if setup invalidated)

### Trade Journal

Record every trade:

- Entry/exit prices
- Reason for trade
- What worked/didn't work
- Emotional state
- Lessons learned
