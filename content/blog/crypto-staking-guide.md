Staking allows you to earn passive income on your cryptocurrency holdings while helping secure blockchain networks. This guide covers everything you need to know about staking in 2026.

## What is Staking?

Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to:

1. **Validate transactions** on proof-of-stake networks
2. **Secure the network** through economic incentives
3. **Earn rewards** in the form of new tokens

Think of it like earning interest in a savings account, but for crypto.

## How Staking Works

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

Unlike Bitcoin's proof of work (mining), PoS networks:

- Select validators based on staked amount
- Reward honest validators with new tokens
- Slash (penalize) malicious validators
- Use much less energy than mining

### Validator Requirements

To run a validator node:

- Minimum stake (e.g., 32 ETH for Ethereum)
- Technical infrastructure (hardware, uptime)
- Knowledge to maintain the node
- Risk of slashing for misbehavior

### Delegated Staking

For most users, delegation is simpler:

- Stake to existing validators
- No technical requirements
- Smaller minimum amounts
- Validators take a fee (5-15%)

## Types of Staking

### Native Staking

Direct staking on the blockchain:

- Highest rewards (no middleman fees)
- Longest lock-up periods
- Most secure (no smart contract risk)
- Requires running a node (for validators)

### Liquid Staking

Stake and receive a liquid token:

- **stETH** (Lido): Staked ETH representation
- **rETH** (Rocket Pool): Decentralized staked ETH
- **mSOL** (Marinade): Staked Solana

**Benefits:**
- Maintain liquidity
- Use in DeFi while earning rewards
- No technical requirements

### Exchange Staking

Stake through centralized exchanges:

- Easiest option
- Lower rewards (exchange takes cut)
- Counterparty risk
- May have minimum lock periods

### Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)

| Token | Asset | APY | Decentralization |
|-------|-------|-----|------------------|
| stETH | ETH | 3-4% | Semi-centralized |
| rETH | ETH | 3-4% | Decentralized |
| cbETH | ETH | 3-3.5% | Centralized |
| mSOL | SOL | 6-7% | Decentralized |
| jitoSOL | SOL | 7-8% | Semi-centralized |

## Popular Staking Options

### Ethereum Staking

**Native staking:**
- Minimum: 32 ETH
- APY: ~3-4%
- Unbonding: Variable (queue dependent)

**Liquid staking:**
- Lido (stETH): Most liquid, largest TVL
- Rocket Pool (rETH): More decentralized
- Coinbase (cbETH): Easy for beginners

### Solana Staking

**Native staking:**
- Minimum: None (but validators have minimums)
- APY: 6-8%
- Unbonding: ~2-3 days (1 epoch)

**Liquid staking:**
- Marinade Finance (mSOL)
- Jito (jitoSOL) - includes MEV rewards

### Cosmos Ecosystem

**Native staking:**
- ATOM, OSMO, and other Cosmos chains
- APY: 10-20% depending on chain
- Unbonding: 14-21 days

**Features:**
- Airdrop eligibility for stakers
- Governance participation
- Growing IBC ecosystem

### Other Notable Staking

| Asset | APY | Unbonding | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----------|-------|
| DOT | 12-15% | 28 days | Polkadot |
| ADA | 4-5% | None | Cardano |
| AVAX | 8-10% | 14 days | Avalanche |
| MATIC | 4-5% | 3-4 days | Polygon |

## Calculating Staking Returns

### Nominal APY

The advertised rate:

```
Annual Rewards = Staked Amount × APY
```

Example: 10 ETH × 4% = 0.4 ETH per year

### Real APY

Accounting for:

1. **Inflation**: Network token inflation dilutes non-stakers
2. **Fees**: Validator fees reduce rewards
3. **Compounding**: Restaking rewards increases returns
4. **Tax**: Rewards may be taxable income

### Compounding Effect

Restaking rewards increases returns:

| Year | Simple APY | Compounded APY |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | 5.00% | 5.00% |
| 2 | 10.00% | 10.25% |
| 3 | 15.00% | 15.76% |
| 5 | 25.00% | 27.63% |
| 10 | 50.00% | 62.89% |

## Risks of Staking

### Slashing Risk

Validators can be penalized for:

- Double signing blocks
- Extended downtime
- Malicious behavior

**Mitigation:**
- Use reputable validators
- Check slashing history
- Diversify across validators

### Lock-up Risk

During unbonding:

- Cannot sell or use tokens
- Price could drop significantly
- Opportunity cost if prices rise elsewhere

**Mitigation:**
- Use liquid staking derivatives
- Maintain some unlocked reserves
- Plan for lock-up periods

### Smart Contract Risk

Liquid staking protocols:

- Could have bugs
- May be exploited
- Protocol failures

**Mitigation:**
- Use audited protocols
- Check TVL and track record
- Don't stake entire portfolio

### Inflation Dilution

If staking rewards come from inflation:

- Non-stakers get diluted
- Real returns may be lower than APY
- Check token emission schedule

## Step-by-Step: Staking ETH with Lido

### Using Lido for Liquid Staking

1. **Go to stake.lido.fi**
2. **Connect your wallet** (MetaMask, etc.)
3. **Enter amount** to stake
4. **Approve transaction** in wallet
5. **Receive stETH** 1:1 for your ETH

Your stETH:
- Earns staking rewards automatically
- Balance increases daily
- Can be used in DeFi
- Tradeable on exchanges

### Using stETH in DeFi

Once you have stETH:

- **Provide liquidity**: stETH/ETH pools
- **Collateral**: Borrow against stETH on Aave
- **Restaking**: Deposit to EigenLayer
- **Hold**: Just hold and earn

## Step-by-Step: Staking SOL

### Native Solana Staking

1. **Open Phantom or Solflare wallet**
2. **Go to Staking section**
3. **Browse validators**
4. **Select validator** (check commission and performance)
5. **Enter amount** and confirm
6. **Start earning** next epoch (~2-3 days)

### Liquid Staking with Marinade

1. **Go to marinade.finance**
2. **Connect wallet**
3. **Stake SOL** for mSOL
4. **Use mSOL** in Solana DeFi
5. **Unstake** anytime (or instant unstake for fee)

## Validator Selection Criteria

### Performance Metrics

- **Uptime**: Should be 99%+
- **Commission**: 5-10% is reasonable
- **Stake size**: Not too concentrated
- **Slashing history**: Should be clean

### Decentralization

Consider staking with:

- Smaller validators (helps decentralization)
- Validators in different locations
- Multiple validators (diversification)

### Governance

Some validators:

- Vote on governance proposals
- Contribute to ecosystem
- Communicate with delegators

## Tax Implications

### Staking Rewards

In most jurisdictions:

- Rewards are taxable income
- Taxed at fair market value when received
- Cost basis = value at receipt

### Record Keeping

Track:

- Date rewards received
- Amount of rewards
- USD value at time of receipt
- Validator/protocol used

### Consult Professionals

Tax rules vary by country. Consider:

- Crypto tax software (Koinly, CoinTracker)
- Professional tax advice
- Keeping detailed records

## Advanced: Restaking

### What is Restaking?

Using staked assets to secure additional protocols:

- EigenLayer on Ethereum
- Earn additional rewards
- Secure new services

### EigenLayer Example

1. Have stETH or other LST
2. Deposit to EigenLayer
3. Secure "actively validated services"
4. Earn additional rewards
5. Additional slashing risk

### Risks

- Additional smart contract risk
- Compounded slashing exposure
- Complex to understand
