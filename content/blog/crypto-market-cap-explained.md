Market capitalization is one of the first metrics investors use to evaluate cryptocurrencies. Understanding what market cap means and its limitations helps you make better investment decisions.

## What is Market Capitalization?

Market cap measures the total value of a cryptocurrency:

```
Market Cap = Current Price × Circulating Supply
```

Example:
- Bitcoin price: $60,000
- Circulating supply: 19.5 million BTC
- Market cap: $60,000 × 19,500,000 = $1.17 trillion

## Types of Market Cap

### Circulating Market Cap

The most commonly used metric:

- Counts only coins currently in circulation
- Excludes locked, reserved, or unreleased tokens
- What you typically see on price trackers

### Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)

Total value if all tokens were in circulation:

```
FDV = Current Price × Max/Total Supply
```

Example:
- Token price: $10
- Circulating: 100 million
- Max supply: 1 billion
- Market cap: $1 billion
- FDV: $10 billion

**Why FDV matters:** Future token unlocks will increase supply, potentially diluting value.

### Total Value Locked (TVL)

For DeFi protocols specifically:

- Assets deposited in the protocol
- Different from token market cap
- Measures protocol usage, not token value

## Market Cap Categories

### Mega-cap ($100B+)

- Bitcoin, Ethereum
- Most liquid and established
- Lower volatility (relatively)
- Institutional investment

### Large-cap ($10B-$100B)

- Top 10-20 projects
- Established with proven track records
- Lower risk than smaller caps
- Examples: BNB, XRP, Solana, Cardano

### Mid-cap ($1B-$10B)

- Established but still growing
- Higher volatility
- More upside potential
- Examples: Polygon, Avalanche, Chainlink

### Small-cap ($100M-$1B)

- Higher risk/reward profile
- Less liquidity
- More susceptible to manipulation
- Potentially higher returns

### Micro-cap (<$100M)

- Very high risk
- Low liquidity
- Many fail or are scams
- Potential for massive gains (rare)

## Using Market Cap for Valuation

### Realistic Price Targets

Market cap helps set realistic expectations:

**Bad thinking:** "If this coin reaches $1000..."
**Better thinking:** "If this coin reaches $10B market cap..."

Example:
- Altcoin at $5 with 500M circulating supply
- Market cap = $2.5 billion
- To 10x, needs $25B market cap (top 10 level)
- Is that realistic for this project?

### Comparing Projects

Market cap allows apple-to-apple comparisons:

Instead of comparing prices:
- Coin A: $50
- Coin B: $0.50
- Which is "cheaper"? Price alone doesn't tell you.

Compare market caps:
- Coin A: $50 × 20M supply = $1B market cap
- Coin B: $0.50 × 10B supply = $5B market cap
- Coin A is actually "smaller"

## The Market Cap Fallacy

### Price ≠ Value

Common mistake: "This coin is cheap at $0.01"

Reality check:
- 1 trillion tokens × $0.01 = $10 billion market cap
- That's a top-20 cryptocurrency
- Not "cheap" at all

### Supply Matters

Two tokens at $1:
- Token A: 1 million supply = $1M market cap
- Token B: 1 billion supply = $1B market cap

Token A has 1000x more room to grow to match Token B's valuation.

## Limitations of Market Cap

### Doesn't Reflect Liquidity

A $1B market cap project may only have:

- $10M daily trading volume
- Large orders cause significant slippage
- Can't easily buy/sell large positions

### Token Distribution Issues

Market cap assumes fair distribution:

- Team might hold 50% (locked or not)
- Whales might control price
- Small float = easy manipulation

### Unrealized Gains

Market cap calculates as if everyone could sell at current price:

- Reality: Selling pressure would crash price
- Only a fraction is "realizable" value
- Paper valuations can be misleading

### Doesn't Measure Utility

High market cap doesn't guarantee:

- Actual usage
- Revenue generation
- Long-term viability

## Better Metrics to Combine

### Market Cap / TVL Ratio

For DeFi protocols:

```
MC/TVL Ratio = Market Cap / Total Value Locked
```

- Ratio < 1: Potentially undervalued
- Ratio > 2: Potentially overvalued

### Price to Revenue (P/R)

For revenue-generating protocols:

```
P/R Ratio = Market Cap / Annual Revenue
```

- Compare to similar protocols
- Lower ratio = potentially undervalued

### FDV / Market Cap Ratio

Measure of future dilution:

```
Dilution Risk = FDV / Market Cap
```

- Ratio of 2: Double the tokens will unlock
- Ratio of 10+: Heavy future dilution

### Trading Volume / Market Cap

Liquidity indicator:

```
Volume Ratio = 24h Volume / Market Cap
```

- < 1%: Low liquidity
- 1-5%: Normal
- > 10%: Very active (or wash trading)

## Market Cap Dominance

### Bitcoin Dominance

Bitcoin's share of total crypto market cap:

```
BTC Dominance = BTC Market Cap / Total Crypto Market Cap
```

**Interpreting dominance:**

- Rising dominance: Risk-off, flight to safety
- Falling dominance: Altcoin season, risk-on
- Historically ranges 40-70%

### Altcoin Season Indicator

When altcoins outperform Bitcoin:

- Top 50 altcoins vs BTC performance
- 75%+ outperforming = Altcoin season
- Rotation from BTC to alts

## Practical Applications

### Portfolio Allocation

Use market cap for allocation decisions:

- Larger caps: Larger positions (less risky)
- Smaller caps: Smaller positions (more risky)
- Match position size to risk tolerance

### Entry/Exit Points

Market cap can guide timing:

- Compare current cap to historical highs
- Consider cap vs fundamentals
- Set targets based on realistic caps

### Project Comparison

When evaluating similar projects:

1. Compare market caps
2. Compare FDV
3. Compare revenue (if available)
4. Consider growth potential

## Key Takeaways

1. **Market cap = Price × Circulating Supply** - Basic valuation metric
2. **FDV accounts for future dilution** - Important for long-term analysis
3. **Categories matter** - Large, mid, small caps have different risk profiles
4. **Price alone is meaningless** - Always consider supply
5. **Market cap has limitations** - Doesn't reflect liquidity or utility
6. **Combine with other metrics** - TVL, revenue, volume for full picture
7. **Use for comparisons** - Not absolute valuations
